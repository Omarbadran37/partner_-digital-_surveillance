# partner_-digital-_surveillance

<b> Problem: </b> The current method to enroll patients in the PARTNER program is based on clinical judgement by Nurses/APPs/Physicians. Monitored through chart review and generalized digital criteria through EHR, under logistic regression has a True Positive Rate of 60% and True Negative rate of 0%.

<b> Proposed Solution: </b>  Using machine learning techniques in Python using ensemble method, such as random forest and voting classify, to improve digital criteria to aide ICU nurses in enrolling patients in the PARTNER program and monitor ICU PARTNER enrollment throughout UPMCâ€™s ICU system.

<b> Result: </b> Through the first iteration showed improved with TPR = 93% and TNR = 80%. The data encompassed all possible outcomes for patients upon discharge. Further iteration will look at the first five days independently since admissions to ICU and be able to identify patients in each day rather than retrospectively.
